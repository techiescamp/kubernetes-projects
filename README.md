## 📑 Phase 1 Projects

In phase 1, we will deploy different types of applications by creating each object manually. If you are learning Kubernetes, this will help you relate each object to real-world setups. It will also help you understand complex Helm charts and create custom application manifests from scratch.

## Project 01: Kubernetes the Hard Way on AWS

You will learn the following from the hard way setup on AWS

- You'll get hands-on experience with Linux commands.
- You'll get hands-on with AWS CLI
- You will learn about systemd
- You'll learn how to generate and manage SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication between components.
- Encrypting data at rest.
- Networking
- As you're setting things up manually, you'll inevitably run into issues, which will teach you valuable troubleshooting skills.

## Project 02: Setup Self Hosted Kubeadm Cluster

It is essential for a DevOps engineer to have a deep understanding of the various components that make up a Kubernetes cluster

Building and maintaining a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster provides valuable hands-on experience and exposes you to the system's complexities. This experience will help you better understand the cluster control plane and worker node components. 

So We strongly suggest using a self-hosted kubernetes cluster during your learning process rather than using easily available solutions. Because Kubeadm allows you to access the VMs and provides the ability to troubleshoot and examine all the cluster components. With a multinode cluster, you can have a setup that mimics the real-world project setup.

Also, If you're preparing for the CKA or CKS exam, it's important to note that cluster management using Kubeadm is part of the exam syllabus.

## Project 03: Deploy Java App With MySQL on Kubernetes

In this project, you will practically use the following key Kubernetes objects. It will help you understand how these objects can be used in real-world project implementations:

- Deployment
- HPA
- ConfigMap
- Secrets
- StatefulSet
- Service
- Namespace

It also covers key concepts such as:

- Startup, readiness, and liveness probes
- Consuming secret and configmap data using Environment Variables
- MySQL initialization script from ConfigMap to create tables
- Creating an application properties file from ConfigMap to be consumed by the app

Additionally, you will go through:

- Building a Java Spring Boot application using Maven
- Dockerizing the Java application and pushing it to Docker Hub

This is a simple but effective project to put your basics into practice. If you learn to work with one app effectively, you can deploy any number of apps. It's all about understanding how to use these objects correctly, and this guide is a good starting point for that.

## Project 04: Deploy WordPress on Kubernetes with Nginx and MySQL

In this project you will learn the steps to deploy WordPress on Kubernetes cluster with Nginx and MySQL database.

It also covers key kubernetes objects such as:

- **PersistantVolumeClaim (PVC)** – This creates and attaches PVs to WordPress Applications and MySQL databases to store data.
- **NetworkPolicy** – Assign a network policy for MySQL to restrict its incoming traffic.

Other Objects include Deployment, Service, Statefulful, Secret, Configmap etc.
